all of a sudden on my way out to the lobby i got old jane gallagher on the brain again i got her on and i couldn't get her off i sat down in this vomity-looking chair in the lobby and thought about her and stradlater sitting in that goddam ed banky's car and though i was pretty damn sure old stradlater hadn't given her the time-i know old jane like a book-i still couldn't get her off my brain i knew her like a book i really did i mean besides checkers she was quite fond of all athletic sports and after i got to know her the whole summer long we played tennis together almost every morning and golf almost every afternoon i really got to know her quite intimately i don't mean it was anything physical or anything-it wasn't-but we saw each other all the time you don't always have to get too sexy to get to know a girl the way i met her this doberman pinscher she had used to come over and relieve himself on our lawn and my mother got very irritated about it she called up jane's mother and made a big stink about it my mother can make a very big stink about that kind of stuff then what happened a couple of days later i saw jane laying on her stomach next to the swimming pool at the club and i said hello to her i knew she lived in the house next to ours but i'd never conversed with her before or anything she gave me the big freeze when i said hello that day though i had a helluva time convincing her that i didn't give a good goddam where her dog relieved himself he could do it in the living room for all i cared anyway after that jane and i got to be friends and all i played golf with her that same afternoon she lost eight balls i remember eight i had a terrible time getting her to at least open her eyes when she took a swing at the ball i improved her game immensely though i'm a very good golfer if i told you what i go around in you probably wouldn't believe me i almost was once in a movie short but i changed my mind at the last minute i figured that anybody that hates the movies as much as i do i'd be a phony if i let them stick me in a movie short she was a funny girl old jane i wouldn't exactly describe her as strictly beautiful she knocked me out though she was sort of muckle-mouthed i mean when she was talking and she got excited about something her mouth sort of went in about fifty directions her lips and all that killed me and she never really closed it all the way her mouth it was always just a little bit open especially when she got in her golf stance or when she was reading a book she was always reading and she read very good books she read a lot of poetry and all she was the only one outside my family that i ever showed allie's baseball mitt to with all the poems written on it she'd never met allie or anything because that was her first summer in maine-before that she went to cape cod-but i told her quite a lot about him she was interested in that kind of stuff my mother didn't like her too much i mean my mother always thought jane and her mother were sort of snubbing her or something when they didn't say hello my mother saw them in the village a lot because jane used to drive to market with her mother in this lasalle convertible they had my mother didn't think jane was pretty even i did though i just liked the way she looked that's all i remember this one afternoon it was the only time old jane and i ever got close to necking even it was a saturday and it was raining like a bastard out and i was over at her house on the porch-they had this big screened-in porch we were playing checkers i used to kid her once in a while because she wouldn't take her kings out of the back row but i didn't kid her much though you never wanted to kid jane too much i think i really like it best when you can kid the pants off a girl when the opportunity arises but it's a funny thing the girls i like best are the ones i never feel much like kidding sometimes i think they'd like it if you kidded them-in fact i know they would-but it's hard to get started once you've known them a pretty long time and never kidded them anyway i was telling you about that afternoon jane and i came close to necking it was raining like hell and we were out on her porch and all of a sudden this booze hound her mother was married to came out on the porch and asked jane if there were any cigarettes in the house i didn't know him too well or anything but he looked like the kind of guy that wouldn't talk to you much unless he wanted something off you he had a lousy personality anyway old jane wouldn't answer him when he asked her if she knew where there was any cigarettes so the guy asked her again but she still wouldn't answer him she didn't even look up from the game finally the guy went inside the house when he did i asked jane what the hell was going on she wouldn't even answer me then she made out like she was concentrating on her next move in the game and all then all of a sudden this tear plopped down on the checkerboard on one of the red squares-boy i can still see it she just rubbed it into the board with her finger i don't know why but it bothered hell out of me so what i did was i went over and made her move over on the glider so that i could sit down next to her-i practically sat down in her lap as a matter of fact then she really started to cry and the next thing i knew i was kissing her all over-anywhere-her eyes her nose her forehead her eyebrows and all her ears-her whole face except her mouth and all she sort of wouldn't let me get to her mouth anyway it was the closest we ever got to necking after a while she got up and went in and put on this red and white sweater she had that knocked me out and we went to a goddam movie i asked her on the way if mr cudahy-that was the booze hound's name-had ever tried to get wise with her she was pretty young but she had this terrific figure and i wouldn't've put it past that cudahy bastard she said no though i never did find out what the hell was the matter some girls you practically never find out what's the matter i don't want you to get the idea she was a goddam icicle or something just because we never necked or horsed around much she wasn't i held hands with her all the time for instance that doesn't sound like much i realize but she was terrific to hold hands with most girls if you hold hands with them their goddam hand dies on you or else they think they have to keep moving their hand all the time as if they were afraid they'd bore you or something jane was different we'd get into a goddam movie or something and right away we'd start holding hands and we wouldn't quit till the movie was over and without changing the position or making a big deal out of it you never even worried with jane whether your hand was sweaty or not all you knew was you were happy you really were one other thing i just thought of one time in this movie jane did something that just about knocked me out the newsreel was on or something and all of a sudden i felt this hand on the back of my neck and it was jane's it was a funny thing to do i mean she was quite young and all and most girls if you see them putting their hand on the back of somebody's neck they're around twenty-five or thirty and usually they're doing it to their husband or their little kid-i do it to my kid sister phoebe once in a while for instance but if a girl's quite young and all and she does it it's so pretty it just about kills you anyway that's what i was thinking about while i sat in that vomity-looking chair in the lobby old jane every time i got to the part about her out with stradlater in that damn ed banky's car it almost drove me crazy i knew she wouldn't let him get to first base with her but it drove me crazy anyway i don't even like to talk about it if you want to know the truth there was hardly anybody in the lobby any more even all the whory-looking blondes weren't around any more and all of a sudden i felt like getting the hell out of the place it was too depressing and i wasn't tired or anything so i went up to my room and put on my coat i also took a look out the window to see if all the perverts were still in action but the lights and all were out now i went down in the elevator again and got a cab and told the driver to take me down to ernie's ernie's is this night club in greenwich village that my brother d b used to go to quite frequently before he went out to hollywood and prostituted himself he used to take me with him once in a while ernie's a big fat colored guy that plays the piano he's a terrific snob and he won't hardly even talk to you unless you're a big shot or a celebrity or something but he can really play the piano he's so good he's almost corny in fact i don't exactly know what i mean by that but i mean it i certainly like to hear him play but sometimes you feel like turning his goddam piano over i think it's because sometimes when he plays he sounds like the kind of guy that won't talk to you unless you're a big shot
